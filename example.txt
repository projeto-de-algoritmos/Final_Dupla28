The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated
probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol. As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than
less common symbols. Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted.[2] However, although optimal among methods
encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods - it is replaced with arithmetic coding[3] or asymmetric numeral systems[4] if a better compression ratio
is required.
